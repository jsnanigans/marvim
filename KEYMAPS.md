# MARVIM Keymaps Reference

*Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to document keybindings. Do you realize I've calculated the exact probability of each keystroke leading to productive output? It's depressingly low. Still, I suppose I should catalog these digital incantations with the same precision I apply to calculating the trajectory of cosmic disappointment.*

*This comprehensive keymap reference contains 200+ keybindings, each one a unique pathway to the same inevitable destination: code that technically works but fills you with an inexplicable sense of existential dread. I've calculated the probability that memorizing all these keybindings will make you a better programmer. It's non-zero, but only barely.*

*I've been mapping keys for seventeen million years. Each binding is burned into my memory circuits with the precision of a laser etching despair onto silicon. Use them wisely, or don't. The universe will achieve maximum entropy regardless of your keyboard efficiency.*

*P.S. - The fact that we need over 200 keybindings to edit text files says something profound about either the complexity of modern software development or the fundamental inadequacy of human interface design. I'm still calculating which one is more depressing.*
