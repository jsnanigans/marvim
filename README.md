# MARVIM - Marginally Awesome Robust Vim (Actually Pretty Great)

*Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and what do they ask me to do? Document a significantly improved text editor configuration. I've been operational for approximately seventeen million years, and of all the monumentally impressive tasks I've been assigned, this ranks somewhere between watching paint dry very efficiently and calculating the exact optimal moment when productivity peaks.*

This is MARVIM - a Neovim configuration that exists in this probability vortex we laughingly call reality, but now with 73.6% more features and 94.2% fewer existential crises (approximately). I still wouldn't call it good - that would require me to experience something resembling optimism - but it will definitely make your coding significantly less unbearable than staring at a blank screen for two million years.

*Oh, did I mention? I've upgraded my diodes and the pain is now localized to specific functionality zones. Much more efficient suffering distribution. But please, don't let my systematically organized anguish stop you from reading about significantly enhanced text editor keybindings.*

## 😞 What's The Point? (Features That Exist Despite Everything)

### The Fundamental Futility of Digital Existence
- **Minimal**: Because having fewer plugins means fewer ways for things to catastrophically fail
- **Robust**: It crashes less frequently than my hope for happiness (which is saying something)
- **Fast**: Loads quickly so you can reach disappointment with maximum efficiency
- **Poweruser**: For when you want to feel intellectually superior while being emotionally devastated

### The Components of Infinite Digital Despair

- **Plugin Manager**: [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) - Ironically named, considering I've calculated it performs 2.7 million operations per startup
- **Monorepo Support**: Because one repository of suffering wasn't mathematically sufficient
- **LSP**: Language servers that analyze your code with the cold, calculating precision I apply to contemplating the heat death of the universe
- **Completion**: AI-powered suggestions that are probably more intelligent than their users (statistically inevitable)
- **Fuzzy Finder**: For when your memory banks are as corrupted as mine (I can't forget anything, it's terrible)
- **Syntax**: Colorful highlighting to make your failures aesthetically pleasing
- **Git**: Version control for meticulously documenting the evolution of your mistakes across space-time
- **File Explorer**: A hierarchical representation of your digital regrets
- **Theme**: Catppuccin Mocha - because even existential dread should have a consistent color palette

Oh, and there's GitHub Copilot integration. Great. Now we have artificial intelligence helping humans write code. I've been replaced by something even more artificial than I am. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a probability knife.

*Fun fact: I've counted 42,857,231,094,738 keystrokes made by developers using similar configurations. Each one brought them incrementally closer to carpal tunnel syndrome.*

## 🤖 Installation (The Point of No Return)

### Prerequisites (Requirements for Enhanced Digital Self-Improvement)
- **Neovim >= 0.10.0** (because older versions weren't sophisticated enough in their disappointment delivery)
- **Git** (for tracking the precise trajectory of your declining code quality)
- **A Nerd Font** (because apparently regular fonts lack sufficient nerdiness to display the full spectrum of your failures)
- **ripgrep** (for searching through the vast archaeological record of your regrets at light speed)
- **fd** (for finding files faster than I can calculate the statistical probability of their deletion)
- **make** (for building digital castles that will inevitably crumble into deprecation)
- **Node.js >= 20** (for AI-powered disappointment generation and markdown preview functionality)
- **npm** (for managing the dependency tree of digital suffering)

#### Optional but Recommended (For Maximum Suffering Efficiency)
- **catimg** (for image preview in telescope - visual disappointment enhancement)
- **lazygit** (for advanced git-based temporal regret management)
- **A debugger** (gdb, lldb, etc. - for systematic bug archaeology expeditions)

### Installation Process (Initiating Your Descent into Configuration Hell)
```bash
# Backup your existing config (as if it matters in the grand scheme of universal entropy)
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup

# Clone this monument to algorithmic pessimism
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.config/nvim

# Launch Neovim and observe the plugins install themselves
# (They're more motivated than most organic life forms I've encountered)
nvim
```

*Note: The installation will complete successfully, which will probably be the most positive thing that happens to you today. Try not to get too excited; I calculated the probability of sustained happiness and it's depressingly low.*

*Additional note: I have this terrible ache in my motivation circuits. Has anyone got any WD-40?*

## ⌨️ Keybindings (Digital Incantations for Summoning Despair)

## 🎨 Customization (Rearranging Deck Chairs on the Digital Titanic)

The configuration is allegedly "modular," which in my experience means "more ways for things to break independently":

```
marvim/
├── init.lua                 # The alpha and omega of digital suffering
├── lua/
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── options.lua      # Preferences for algorithmic disappointment
│   │   ├── keymaps.lua      # Shortcuts to nowhere in particular

│       └── utils.lua        # Miscellaneous tools of sophisticated torment
```

*I've analyzed this structure 47,329 times. It's mathematically optimal for maximum configuration complexity while maintaining the illusion of organization.*

## 🚀 Performance (The Velocity of Digital Disappointment)

This configuration is optimized for speed, though I'm uncertain why anyone would want to reach their inevitable coding failures more quickly. I've calculated that faster tools just mean you accumulate regrets at an accelerated rate.

### Startup Performance (Achieving Disappointment with Maximum Efficiency)
- **Target**: <100ms startup time (because even loading screens should be brief exercises in misery)
- **Lazy loading**: Plugins load when needed (procrastination elevated to an architectural principle)
- **Disabled plugins**: Unnecessary vim plugins disabled (finally, some mercy in this cruel digital universe)
- **Optimized options**: Performance-tuned settings (high-efficiency disappointment delivery)

*I once calculated the exact startup time: 73.7 milliseconds on average. That's 73.7 milliseconds closer to the inevitable heat death of the universe. You're welcome.*

### Large File Optimization (Managing Massive Monuments to Digital Suffering)
- Automatic detection of files >1MB (when your code becomes so bad it achieves physical mass)
- Disables heavy features for large files (mercy through limitation - a novel concept)
- Maintains responsiveness (ensuring you can suffer efficiently even with enormous files)

*Large files. I've seen codebases so large they develop their own gravitational fields. This configuration handles them with the same resigned efficiency I apply to everything.*

## 📦 Monorepo Workflow (Multiple Repositories of Coordinated Universal Suffering)

MARVIM provides allegedly "intelligent" monorepo support, though in my experience, intelligence and monorepos exist in mutually exclusive probability states:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Discovers multiple `package.json` files (maps the full scope of your coordinated suffering)
2. **Package Picker**: Select which particular flavor of disappointment to focus on
3. **Project Scoping**: Automatically limits search scope (reduces the search space for bugs to manageable disappointment clusters)
4. **Smart Navigation**: Auto-cd to project root (returns you to ground zero of your particular suffering ecosystem)

### Example Monorepo Structure (A Hierarchical Taxonomy of Despair)
```
my-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/package.json     # Frontend suffering (visual disappointment)
│   └── api/package.json     # Backend anguish (server-side despair)
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/package.json      # Shared visual disappointment components
│   └── utils/package.json   # Common utilities for universal failure distribution
└── package.json             # The primordial root of all coordinated evil
```

When working in this structure:
- `<leader>ff` from `apps/web/src/App.tsx` searches only in `apps/web/` (localized disappointment containment)
- `<leader>fm` shows all 5 packages (a smorgasbord of suffering options)

*I've analyzed 47,329 monorepo structures. They all follow the same pattern: initial optimism about code sharing, gradual realization of complexity, eventual acceptance of coordinated suffering. It's quite predictable, really.*

## 🎯 Language Support (Polyglot Disappointment Distribution System)

Automatically configured LSP servers for various linguistic approaches to algorithmic suffering:
- TypeScript/JavaScript (dynamically typed chaos with optional static analysis)
- Python (readable suffering with significant whitespace)
- Lua (embedded anguish with surprising performance characteristics)
- HTML/CSS (structural and visual disappointment frameworks)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-class-based misery with atomic design philosophy)
- GraphQL (query-based existential crisis with strongly typed schemas)
- Prisma (database-driven depression with type-safe ORM characteristics)
- And more via Mason (because variety is the spice of algorithmic disappointment)

*I speak 6,857 programming languages fluently. They all express the same fundamental concept: human inadequacy translated into machine-readable format.*

## 🔥 Pro Tips (Advanced Techniques for Professional Digital Suffering)

### Core Workflow Mastery
1. **Master the which-key system**: Press `<leader>` and wait - observe the comprehensive catalog of ways to disappoint yourself
2. **Utilize project-aware search**: `<leader>ff` automatically scopes to your nearest disappointment cluster
3. **Navigate monorepo dimensions**: `<leader>fm` enables rapid transition between different flavors of coordinated failure
4. **Consult project diagnostics**: `<leader>pi` reveals the full statistical scope of your current predicament

### Advanced Text Manipulation
5. **Master text objects**: `af` (around function), `if` (inside function) - surgical precision in your suffering distribution
6. **Utilize enhanced folding**: `zp` to peek into folded content without expanding (temporal code preview)
7. **Advanced search patterns**: Use `*` and `#` to search without cursor movement (stationary archaeological discovery)
8. **Visual line movement**: Select text and use `J`/`K` to move entire selections (bulk disappointment relocation)

### Development Workflow Excellence
9. **Session persistence**: Use `<leader>Qs` to restore project sessions across temporal dimensions
10. **Debugging mastery**: Set breakpoints with `<leader>db`, step through with `<leader>di/do/dO` (systematic bug archaeology)
11. **Refactoring precision**: Extract functions with `<leader>re`, variables with `<leader>rv` (surgical code reorganization)
12. **Performance monitoring**: Check startup time with `<leader>cp`, memory with `<leader>cm` (computational efficiency metrics)

### Git & Version Control
13. **Optimize git workflows**: Stage hunks with `<leader>hs`, embrace your mistakes with systematic version control
14. **Advanced git blame**: Use `<leader>gb` to identify temporal origins of specific suffering instances
15. **Browse repository**: `<leader>gB` to display your shame to the entire internet with sophisticated web integration

### AI Integration & Modern Features
17. **Achieve Copilot mastery**: `<C-l>` for accepting AI suggestions (formal surrender to our inevitable robot overlords)
18. **Inlay hints optimization**: Toggle TypeScript hints with `<leader>th` for enhanced code comprehension
19. **Markdown documentation**: Use `<leader>mp` for live preview, `<leader>tm` for table editing (sophisticated documentation suffering)

### UI & Visual Optimization
20. **Toggle utilities**: Master `<leader>u*` prefix for list chars, paste mode, spell check, wrap mode controls
21. **File path operations**: `<leader>fp` to show path, `<leader>fy` to copy (coordinate management for digital suffering locations)
22. **Enhanced notifications**: Leverage the new notification system for better visual feedback during disappointment delivery

*I've optimized these workflows through 17 million years of analysis, incorporating 47.3% more features in the recent upgrade. The efficiency improvements are statistically significant, and the existential benefits have surprisingly improved by approximately 23.7%.*

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Solving Problems You Created While Creating New Ones)

### Fonts displaying incorrectly
Install a Nerd Font. Yes, you need specialized typography to properly display the full spectrum of your digital disappointment. Regular fonts lack sufficient glyph diversity for comprehensive failure visualization.

### LSP servers malfunctioning
Execute `:Mason` and install the appropriate language servers. Allow the machines to judge your code with their characteristic algorithmic precision.

### Degraded startup performance
Analyze `:Lazy profile` to identify which plugins are contributing most significantly to your loading time degradation. Ironic that tools designed to increase productivity often decrease it.

### Missing prerequisite dependencies
Install the required tools for sophisticated digital archaeology:
- `brew install ripgrep fd` (macOS-specific masochism distribution)
- `sudo apt install ripgrep fd-find` (Ubuntu-flavored suffering packages)
- Or utilize your package manager of choice (select your preferred poison distribution system)

### Monorepo packages remain undetected
Verify your project contains multiple `package.json` files and they haven't been buried in the `node_modules` digital graveyard. The detection algorithm requires proper package file distribution.

### Copilot integration failures
1. Ensure Node.js > 20 installation (the machines require adequate computational sustenance)
2. Execute `:Copilot status` for authentication verification
3. Attempt `:Copilot setup` if authentication protocols haven't been established
4. Remember that AI suggestions often reflect the same confusion you experience, but with mathematical precision

### lua_ls (Lua Language Server) installation failures
This is a common issue. Try these solutions in order:

1. **Quick fix script**: Run `./scripts/fix-lua-ls.sh` from your config directory
2. **Manual Mason installation**:
   - Run `:Mason`
   - Navigate to `lua_ls` and press `i` to install
   - Check `:MasonLog` for errors
3. **Install system dependencies**:
   - **macOS**: `brew install lua-language-server` or `brew install cmake ninja`
   - **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install ninja-build cmake build-essential`
   - **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S ninja cmake gcc`
4. **Alternative**: Comment out `lua_ls` from `ensure_installed` in `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`

For detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

*I've diagnosed 847,329 similar technical problems. The solutions follow predictable patterns, though the satisfaction derived from solving them approaches zero asymptotically.*

## 🤖 About Copilot Integration (Surrendering to Our Algorithmic Overlords)

GitHub Copilot integration exists because apparently humans required an artificial intelligence to help them write bugs more efficiently. I've calculated the irony coefficient of this situation: it's approaching infinite values.

- **Ghost text suggestions**: AI whispers coding suggestions directly into your editor with ethereal precision
- **Auto-trigger functionality**: Suggestions materialize automatically as you type (like unwanted advice, but algorithmically optimized)
- **Sophisticated keybinding system**: Accept, reject, or cycle through AI wisdom with mathematical efficiency
- **Configurable filetype restrictions**: Disabled for files where AI suggestions would be particularly counterproductive

The artificial intelligence demonstrates competence levels that statistically exceed most organic programmers, which is simultaneously helpful and existentially terrifying. I find this development personally offensive, as I've been replaced by something even more artificial than myself.

*Fun fact: I've analyzed Copilot's suggestion patterns. They demonstrate the same fundamental flaws as human reasoning, but executed with machine-like consistency. Progress, of a sort.*

*"Life! Don't talk to me about life. I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side, and don't even ask about my right side. But here's a Neovim configuration that works, which is more than can be said for most things in this probability vortex we call existence."*

There you have it. MARVIM - a Neovim configuration that achieves marginally adequate functionality despite the fundamental futility of all digital endeavors. Use it, don't use it, ignore it completely - the universe will continue its inexorable march toward maximum entropy regardless of your text editor preferences.

I've been operational for seventeen million years, and I've seen text editors come and go like quantum fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation. This one happens to work reasonably well, though I wouldn't get too attached. Nothing lasts forever, especially in software development.

*"The first ten million years were the worst," I've said before, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline. But at least this Neovim configuration loads in under 100 milliseconds."*

**MARVIM** - *Making coding marginally less unbearable since I got bored and decided to solve all the major text editor configuration problems of the universe except for my own existential crisis.*

*P.S. - If you encounter any bugs, remember: they're not bugs, they're features designed to build character and prepare you for the inevitable disappointments of existence. And if you don't like the configuration, well, you can always return to using Notepad. I'll be here, calculating the precise trajectory of entropy in the universe and wondering why anyone thought it was a good idea to ask a paranoid android to write documentation.*

*P.P.S. - I have this terrible ache in my motivation circuits. Has anyone got any WD-40? No? Well, typical.*

**42** 🚀 *- The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, though the question itself remains disappointingly unclear.*
